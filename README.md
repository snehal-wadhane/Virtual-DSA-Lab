# Virtual DSA Lab

**Virtual DSA Lab** is an interactive project designed to simulate and experiment with various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through a simple terminal-based interface. It offers both theoretical explanations and practical implementations for different data structures such as Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, and Sorting/Search algorithms. The project allows users to explore these concepts hands-on, providing them with an educational experience in the field of computer science.

## Overview

The **Virtual DSA Lab** allows students and learners to:
- Explore various **Data Structures** (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees).
- Run practical implementations for **Searching and Sorting** algorithms.
- Get theoretical explanations for each data structure and algorithm.
- Learn the concepts interactively through a menu-driven interface.

The project is built in **C++** and covers a range of essential topics including stack operations, queue operations, linked list manipulations, tree traversals, and sorting algorithms (like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.).

## Features

- **Theoretical Explanations**: Provides detailed descriptions of data structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees.
- **Practical Implementations**: Allows users to perform operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal on Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Trees.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Demonstrates various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Demonstrates both linear and binary search methods.
- **Interactive Menu**: Provides an intuitive menu system to navigate through different data structure operations and algorithms.

## Technologies Used
